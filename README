This is my public play project for network automation.  I'm not sure how far it will go, but I'd love for it to slowly evolve
from mostly incoherent nonsense and experimentation to something real.  I'll be treating it as a serious project all the way,
documenting, responding to issues, and the like.  Please feel free to reach out to me at jhunt@westvirginia.com
